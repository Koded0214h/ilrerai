# TODO: Disconnect Backend from Frontend with Dummy Data

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Update `frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts` to return dummy data for all API methods instead of making real API calls.
- [x] Update `frontend/src/lib/ai-service.ts` to return predefined dummy responses for all AI functions.
- [x] Read and update `frontend/src/store/slices/patientSlice.ts` to initialize and use dummy patient data.
- [x] Read and update `frontend/src/store/slices/facilitySlice.ts` to initialize and use dummy facility data.
- [x] Run the frontend development server to test that everything works with dummy data.
